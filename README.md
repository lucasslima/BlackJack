BlackJack
=========

Simple black jack game implementation (coding demo)

Abstract playing card and player classes are defined in the cards.h, players.h headers.  These classes are extended to BlackJack classes by the 
BlackJack.h header.  Game play is implemented in the BlackJack.cpp file, which contains the main method for BlackJack play.
